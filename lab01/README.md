## Running our first container.

In this section, we'll run an Ubuntu 16.04 container to see how things work.

At the terminal enter:

```

$ docker pull ubuntu:16.04

```

This brings the ubuntu container to our local machine and stores it in the docker repository. From there you can see a list of all the containers in the local repository.

```

$ docker images

```

Now we can run the ubuntu container

```
$ docker run -it --name myFirstContainer ubuntu /bin/bash
root@d9389be0b795:/#
root@d9389be0b795:/# ls
bin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lib64  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var
root@d9389be0b795:/#
root@d9389be0b795:/#
root@d9389be0b795:/# exit
exit
$

```

We can see the list of containers that are running, or that have exited

```
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
d9389be0b795        ubuntu              "/bin/bash"         4 minutes ago       Exited (0) 2 minutes ago                       myFirstContainer
```

... and we can remove any containers that are no longer in use

```
$ docker rm myFirstContainer
myFirstContainer

```

Congratulations! - you've run your first container!
