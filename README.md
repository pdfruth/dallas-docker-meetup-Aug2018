**Session Objective:**  Companies need rapid innovation to rollout new business models, optimize business processes, and respond to new regulations. And business leaders and employees are demanding this agility â€“ everyone wants to be able to connect to their Line of Business (LOB) systems through mobile devices or remotely in a secure and efficient manner, no matter how old or new these systems are.

Enter application modernization. 

Application modernization can include the re-platforming, re-hosting, re-coding, re-factoring, re-architecting, re-building, or the replacement and retirement of your legacy systems. 

We'll discuss many of the aspects surrounding the topic of applicaiton modernization.  In addition to lecture and discussion there will be a hands on lab to demonstrate the some of the topics presented.
